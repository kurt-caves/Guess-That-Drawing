<h3>About</h3>
<p>Guess That Drawing is an idea that was hashed out by our team members for the 371 Software Development Spring 2023 course project. The project is a 
 multiplayer game where one person draws an object while the other players guess what the object is and submit their guesses in a chat box. The project was 
 developed entirely in Unity and git was used for version control.</p>
<h2>****Notice of Future Work****</h2>
<p>To keep in the integrity of our documentation this notice is posted for all the design elements and features that we did not have time to implement.
At this level, the drawer accesses to just one word for drawing. You can change the functionality that drawer has a chance to select one of three words. Also
you can have a word bank contains three categories(Easy, Medium and Hard)and some sub-categories for each one, and have an option to choose on of theses 
sub-categories. 

You can add another waiting room that is located before starting to draw. That gives some seconds to the drawer to think about how draws the word.

You can also change the scoring system to have a dynamic scoring system. Each player who guess sooner gets more credit. That makes the game be more competitive.

One option you can add to the game is time settings. The time of the each round can ghange by the difficaulty of the word that the drawer chooses. If The
drawer chooses a hard word, time is set on for example 120 seconds.</p>
