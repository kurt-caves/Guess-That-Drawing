<h3>About</h3>
<p>Guess That Drawing is an idea that was hashed out by our team members for the 371 Software Development Spring 2023 course project. The project is a multiplayer game where one person draws an object while the other players guess what the object is and submit their guesses in a chat box. The project was developed entirely in Unity and git was used for version control.</p>
