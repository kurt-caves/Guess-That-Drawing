<h2>****Notice of Future Work****</h2>
<p>To keep in the integrity of our documentation this notice is posted for the design features that we were unable to achieve and have been left for future work.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each client relies on a local machine running the Unity project and is not currently hosted online.</li>

<h2> Explanation </h2>
<p>
In our client/server architecture, the game is hosted on a central server that communicates with multiple clients. Each client is responsible for sending their drawings and guesses to the game server.
<br><br>
Upon receiving  information from the client,  the server calculates a game state. Information in the game state include: player scores, chat messages, and pixels on the drawing board. The game server then sends the game state back to the client. Once the client receives the information, their graphic user interface is updated to reflect the changes.
<br><br>
The database is responsible for storing important information, such as user accounts, game state, and game history. The game server may request information from the server as needed.
<br><br>
Overall, this architecture allows for communication and data storage to be centralized and managed by the game server.
<br><br>

<h2> Major Classes </h2>
The major classes are: PixelArtDrawingSystem, PixelArtDrawingSystemVisual, LobbyManager, RelayManager, ChatManager, and GameBehavior.
<br><br>
LobbyManager and RelayManager are classes used to handle the networking. LobbyManager allows users to connect before the game starts,  while RelayManager allows users to send/receive information in real-time during the game without a dedicated server.
<br><br>
GameBehavior is used to handle the mechanics of the game by allowing players to take turns guessing/drawing. GameBehavior relies on WordBank to generate a secret word, and calls the PlayerList methods to update each player's score and status as an artist/guesser.
<br><br>
ChatManager is used to control the behavior of the multiplayer chatbox.
<br><br>
PixelArtDrawingSystem and PixelArtDrawingSystemVisual are classes used to construct the canvas. PixelArtDrawingSystem initializes the canvas and PixelArtDrawingSystemVisual applies updates made from PixelArtDrawingSystem onto the mesh to display the canvas.
