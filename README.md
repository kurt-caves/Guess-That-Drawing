# Guess-That-Drawing
CS 371 Software Development Project Spring Semester 2023

# Project Description
Our goal is to create a multiplayer guessing game where one person draws an object, while the other players use a chat box to guess what the object is.

Currently, our project contains a simple but functional lobby and chatbox. The lobby allows players to create/join a public server, and the chat box allows for real-time communication within the server. We also started developing a drawing board for players with a variety of tools, including a pen and eraser.
