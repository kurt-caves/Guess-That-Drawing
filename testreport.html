<h1>Test Report.html</h1>

<h2>1- Component Testing </h2>
<p>During the development of our Unity-based multiplayer drawing and guessing game, we performed component testing to ensure that 
each part of the system functioned correctly. The main components tested were:</p>

<ol><li><h4>Drawing tools:</h4><p>We tested the functionality of the different drawing tools, such as brush sizes, colors, and eraser.
We used a variety of test cases to cover the expected requirements, including edge cases where users might try to draw outside the canvas
or use unusual input methods.</p></li>

<li><h4>Chat system:</h4><p> We tested the chat system to ensure that messages are sent and received correctly between players.
We used a combination of automated unit tests and manual testing to validate chat functionality, covering different message lengths
and special characters.</p></li>

<li><h4>Scoring system:</h4><p> We created a set of unit tests to check the correctness of the scoring system, including edge cases where
multiple players guess the drawing simultaneously or no one guesses it correctly.</p></li>

<li><h4>Server communication:</h4><p> We tested the communication between the client and the server to ensure that requests and responses
were processed correctly. We tested the API endpoints using various requests to ensure the server could handle various types of requests.</p></li></ol>

<h2>2- System Testing</h2>
<p>For system testing, we conducted end-to-end tests with different user scenarios to ensure that the overall game functioned correctly.
The scenarios covered the entire game flow, including creating a new game, inviting players, guessing drawings, and displaying scores at
the end of each round.</p>

<p>We selected test cases to cover a wide range of user behaviors and potential issues, such as poor network connections, late-joining players,
or players leaving the game mid-round. We utilized Unity tools to simulate multiple players simultaneously and monitor the system's performance
under load.</p>

<h2>3- Acceptance Testing</h2>
<p>To validate if features were considered accepted by users, we used the acceptance criteria from our user stories to drive our system testing.
Here is a list of our user stories and their acceptance status:</p>

<ol><li><h4>Host a server with their friends: Accepted.</h4><p>
There are two buttons, host and join, after specifying a username at the very first step. By pushing the "host" button you can create a lobby with
the specific name generated by the server. Other players can push the "join" button and select the lobby they want to join. </p></li>

<li><h4>Choose drawing prompts: Accepted.</h4><p>
At this step, there is a word bank that each player who is his turn can select one word of the word bank randomly. He will draw when the word was shown.
We are working on word bank to have three categories of words, Easy, Medium and Hard. Also we are working on having three choices of words that the user
can choose one word from that three words.</p></li>

<li><h4>Customize player avatar and username: Accepted.</h4><p>
Each users must specify a username at the very first step of the game. After that he/she can create or join a game. At this step, we do not have any
choices for avatar but we are working on. We will add some avatars to the game and program the game so that each users can choose an avatar.</p></li>

<li><h4>Customize drawing tools: Accepted.</h4><p>
At this step of programming the game, users can draw four colors,White, Green, Blue and Red. They can do this by pushing W, G, B or R respectively for
each color and click on the drawing board.</p></li>

<li><h4>Rejoin a game: Accepted.</h4><p>
Rejoining a game is a feature of our game. If a user accidentally leave a game, he/she can push the "join" button and select the lobby he/she wants to join.
At this step we don't care about the score of a user, but we are working on. We don't know if we can save the score of the user when he/she leaves a game.</p></li></ol>


<p>With the completion of our testing process, we have created a new release for our project page. The version number has been increased  to 1.0  to reflect
the improvements and bug fixes implemented during the testing phase.</p>
